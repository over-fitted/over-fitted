### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrew, a Year 3 CS Major! I'm interested in cool stuff that really makes you think, and in the realm of CS that has taken me all over the place from data engineering to parallel computing. Always looking for a new shiny thing to add to my never-ending backlog of study material.

Currently working on improving my Web Development skills, stay tuned for my new website!

## Past Projects
#### [Coffier - Hack and Roll 2023](https://github.com/hrtowii/hnr2023)
Hackathon React Native/Typescript project working with 3 pre-university students.
Coffier is a Coffee Timer app meant to accompany users of James Hoffman's coffee brewing techniques, abstracting the guesswork and timer management away from the user.
We focused on improving the usability of the app for intermediate users, primarily by reducing the number of clicks required to brew coffee and reducing visual clutter, so that we could personally find use with this app past the hackathon. (Success, I still use it to this day!)
Find the app on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hnr2023.coffier)

## Past School Projects
### Databases
#### [CS3223 Databases Systems Implementation](https://github.com/cs3223-proj-31/cs3223-project/commits/main)
Added features to SimpleDB, a Java-based stripped-down SQL DBMS. We added query optimisation, table joins and index usage among other features, with corresponding syntax lexing and parsing.
#### [CS2102 Intro to Databases](https://github.com/over-fitted/CS2102-Project)
Designed relational database schema with ER diagram, implemented the database in PostgreSQL with triggers and procedures, analysed database optimisations with respect to choice in respecting normal forms. 

### OS, Parallel Computing and Networks
#### [CS3210 Parallel Computing](https://github.com/over-fitted/CS3210)
<!-- ##### [Troons V1](https://github.com/nus-cs3210/cs3210-a1-a1-a0187646m_a0217487u) -->
##### Troons V1
C++ programme parallelised with OpenMP, modelling train system state management.
Initially worked on separate implementations with different methodologies in parallel, chose my partner's overall implementation.
Fixed bugs, worked on benchmarking on Slurm nodes.

<!-- ##### [Virus Signature Scanner](https://github.com/nus-cs3210/cs3210-a3-a3-a0187646m_a0217487u) -->
##### Virus Signature Scanner
C++ programme parallelised with CUDA, scanning file signatures for viruses based on input virus signatures with wildcards.
Added asynchronous file transfer to GPU, CUDA host function callbacks and pre-computation optimisations,
resulting in 20% speedup.

<!-- ##### [Troons V2](https://github.com/nus-cs3210/cs3210-a3-a3-a0187646m_a0217487u) -->
##### Troons V2
Same as Troons V1, but using MPI.
